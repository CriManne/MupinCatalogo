- If a component is deleted (softly) it cant be recreated because it will throw a duplicated name error.
Solution: add Erased field and show it in the table when visualizing it

- nest add_user and admin views so it cant be reached with ?page=add_user

- Check nullable fields

- Make a method in search artifact engine selectByIdAndCategory to return a specific object and not a 
generic one. You cant change the selectById because its used in the single artifact page so it needs a generic
model

- add comments to controllers

- IN SERVICES AND OTHERS CHANGE if(* == null) to if(!*)

- Change the request type to a json object to be a correct rest api

- add tags and generic object fields in the search by key

- ADD MONOLOG: handle two level of logging: minimum (just employees logs), max (every controller log)
  Add page in the admin dashboard to choose between the two modes and to open a file of logs.
  (artifact_logs,component_logs,user_logs,public_logs,)
