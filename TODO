- Divide the route controllers in public and private:  
    - public: is the hosted website which is also divided in public area and employees area
    - private: are the endpoints to which the website get data

- Leave the private endpoints without Authentication during development. But
!!!REMEMBER TO ENABLE Authentication with BasicAuth pipeline!!!

    because the erased field is used to delete softly a record to avoid integrity fails
    the active field could be used to disable an object so is not show in the catalog but still available
    and it can be reactivated

- REFACTOR CODE, FIX COPY AND PASTE TYPOS AND RENAME $s PARAMETERS AND REMOVE UNUSED IMPORTS

- CHECK BAD INSERTS TEST FOR MODEL WITH UNIQUE NAMES

- USE mysql_real_escape_string TO CLEAN INPUTS

- Implement documentation for the showErased PARAMETER

- On insert when returning the object inserted fill the ids

- improve select alls

- *OPTIONAL* update integration test on insert and compare the select result with the insert result

- REMOVE REPOSITORIES AND SERVICES METHODS NOT USED
