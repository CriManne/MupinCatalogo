    - public: is the hosted website which is also divided in public area and employees area
    - private: are the endpoints to which the website get data

- Leave the private endpoints without Authentication during development. But
!!!REMEMBER TO ENABLE Authentication with BasicAuth pipeline!!!

- WHEN TESTING REPOSITORIES WITH RELATIONS ADD TESTS WITHOUT FOREIGN KEY CHECKS AND
OTHER TESTS WITH THE FK CHECKS AND EXPECT EXPECTIONS

- WHEN SELECTING TRY TO MAP OBJECT WITH:
  $result->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_INTO, new vegetables);
  return $result;

- REMEMBER TO HANDLE THE ACTIVE FIELD OF GENERIC OBJECT
