# Museum Catalog

This is an open-source project for the inventory management of a museum.


The [Mupin Museum](https://www.mupin.it/) was used as a reference in this case.

Design patterns implemented:
- REST API
- ORM 
- MVC
- Singleton
- SOLID principles
- Factory pattern

The system was built using TDD with [PHPUNIT](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit).

The repository layer was almost entirely abstracted by the [AbstractRepo library](https://github.com/CriManne/AbstractRepo).
