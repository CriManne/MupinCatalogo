# Museum Catalog

This is an open-source project for the inventory management of a museum.
<br>
The [Mupin Museum](https://www.mupin.it/) was used as a reference in this case.
<br>
It has also implemented RESTful, ORM and MVC design patterns.
<br>
The software was built with TDD principles using the test framework [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit).
